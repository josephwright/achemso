# `achemso` - Support for submissions to American Chemical Society journals

## Description

The `achemso` bundle provides a LaTeX class file and BibTeX style file in
accordance with the requirements of the American Chemical Society (ACS). The
files can be used for any documents, but have been carefully designed and
tested to be suitable for submission to ACS journals.

The bundle also includes the `natmove` package. This package is loaded by
`achemso`, and provides automatic moving of superscript citations after
punctuation.
