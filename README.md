# `achemso` - American Chemical Society journal style

## Description

The `achemso` bundle provides a BibTeX style file following the requirements of
the American Chemical Society (ACS), and a package to pass settings to the
BibTeX style. It also includes a class which was used for submission support in
the past.

All of this material is largely of historical interest and is retained for
stability. For new material, the `biblatex` style `chem-acs` is available for
bibliographies, and a short template for the ACS website is better suited to
submission.
